- A Resend account (for email functionality testing)
- Basic understanding of React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

### First-Time Contributors

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/corporate-communications-portal.git
   cd corporate-communications-portal
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up your development environment** (see Development Setup below)
5. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Environment Configuration

1. **Supabase Setup**:
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Configure the database schema using the provided migrations
   - Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Create an admin user in the `admin_users` table

2. **Environment Variables**:
   The application uses Supabase's automatic environment variable configuration. Ensure your Supabase project is properly connected.

3. **Email Service Setup** (Optional for development):
   - Create a Resend account
   - Add your Resend API key to Supabase Edge Functions secrets
   - Configure domain verification for production email delivery

4. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Database Schema

The application uses the following core tables:
- `admin_users` - Administrator account management
- `employees` - Employee data organized by pillars
- `admin_audit_log` - Security audit trail

Refer to the migration files in `supabase/migrations/` for the complete schema.

## üîí Security Considerations

Security is paramount in this enterprise application. All contributions must adhere to strict security standards:

### Security Requirements

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
   - Validate data types, lengths, and formats
   - Use the provided security utilities in `src/utils/security.ts`

2. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Maintain admin-only access controls
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use Row Level Security (RLS) for database access

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens)
   - Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
   - Use HTTPS for all communications

4. **Audit Logging**:
   - Log all administrative actions
   - Include IP addresses and user agents
   - Maintain comprehensive audit trails

### Security Review Process

All security-related changes require:
- Thorough code review by maintainers
- Security testing and validation
- Documentation of security implications
- Approval from project security lead

## üìù Code Standards

### Code Style

We follow strict coding standards to maintain consistency and readability:

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Prefer functional programming patterns

#### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Use proper prop types and interfaces
- Implement loading and error states

#### CSS/Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the design system defined in `src/index.css`
- Implement responsive design (mobile-first)
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure accessibility compliance

#### File Organization
- Keep files under 300 lines
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Organize related components in directories
- Separate concerns (components, utils, types)
- Remove unused files and dependencies

### Code Examples

#### Component Structure
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ 
  title, 
  children, 
  className 
}) => {
  return (
    <div className={cn('base-styles', className)}>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">{title}</h2>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Component;
```

#### Security Implementation
```typescript
import { sanitizeHtml, validateEmailContent } from '@/utils/security';

const handleSubmit = (data: FormData) => {
  // Validate input
  const errors = validateEmailContent(data.subject, data.content);
  if (errors.length > 0) {
    throw new Error('Validation failed');
  }
  
  // Sanitize content
  const sanitizedContent = sanitizeHtml(data.content);
  
  // Process safely...
};
```
